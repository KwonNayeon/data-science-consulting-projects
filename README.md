# Data Science Consulting Solutions
This repository contains my independent data science projects focusing on solving real-world business problems using data-driven solutions.

## 🎯 Current Project: Modern Spam Detection
This project aims to develop an advanced spam detection system that addresses the evolving nature of unwanted communications. Traditional binary spam classification is becoming inadequate as spam tactics grow more sophisticated, operating in "gray areas" that challenge conventional filters.

### Motivation
Motivated by personal experiences with subtle spam across various platforms (messaging apps, YouTube comments), this project seeks to create a more nuanced detection system that can identify and filter sophisticated, ambiguous cases that current systems often miss.

### Industry Applications
- **Retail**: Customer communication quality, review authenticity detection
- **Finance**: Enhanced fraud detection, security communication
- **Manufacturing**: Supply chain communication security, B2B communication optimization

## 🛠 Tech Stack
### Core
- Python 3.x
- AWS Cloud Services
- Causal Inference Tools

### Python Libraries
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **NLP**: NLTK, spaCy
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Cloud Infrastructure (Planned)
- AWS S3
- AWS SageMaker
- AWS Lambda

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Development of ML models for "gray area" spam detection
- Integration of causal inference for better understanding of spam patterns
- Cross-platform approach (messages, social media comments)
- MVP development with focus on user experience

## 🚧 Development Status
Initial Planning Phase:
- Setting up project infrastructure
- Documenting motivation and requirements
- Planning data collection strategy

## 📝 Setup Notes
- **Python environment setup** [Coming soon]
